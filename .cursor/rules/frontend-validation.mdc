# Frontend Validation Guide

Frontend validation in the application follows specific patterns:

- [utils/validations/](mdc:apps/web/src/utils/validations): Contains shared validation utilities and schemas.
- Form validations typically use a validation library (like Zod or Yup) for schema-based validation.
- Validation logic is separated from UI components for better reusability and testing.
- Server-side validation errors are handled and displayed appropriately in the UI.

Validation schemas are often shared between client and server to ensure consistent validation across the application.
