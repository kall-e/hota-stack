# Web App Structure Guide

The main web application is located in [apps/web/src](mdc:apps/web/src). Key directories include:

- [components/](mdc:apps/web/src/components): Shared UI components, including layout and navigation elements.
- [features/](mdc:apps/web/src/features): Feature-specific logic and UI, organized by domain (e.g., auth, dashboard, tweets).
- [routes/](mdc:apps/web/src/routes): Route definitions and layouts, including protected and public routes, as well as error pages.
- [lib/](mdc:apps/web/src/lib): Shared libraries and utilities for the web app.
- [utils/](mdc:apps/web/src/utils): Utility functions and validation logic.

Entry point: [main.tsx](mdc:apps/web/src/main.tsx)
