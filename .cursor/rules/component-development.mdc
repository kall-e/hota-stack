# Component Development Guide

UI components follow specific patterns throughout the project:

- **Shared Components**: Located in [packages/ui/src/components](mdc:packages/ui/src/components), these are reusable across the entire application.
  
- **App-Specific Components**: Located in [apps/web/src/components](mdc:apps/web/src/components), these are specific to the web application.

- **Feature Components**: Located within each feature directory (e.g., [apps/web/src/features/tweets/components](mdc:apps/web/src/features/tweets/components)), these are specific to a particular feature.

When developing components:
- Maintain clear component interfaces with proper TypeScript typing
- Follow the composable component pattern for flexibility
- Separate presentation from logic when appropriate
- Store related hooks in appropriate locations ([packages/ui/src/hooks](mdc:packages/ui/src/hooks) for shared hooks)
- Handle loading, error, and empty states consistently
