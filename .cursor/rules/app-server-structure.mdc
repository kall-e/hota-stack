# Server Application Structure Guide

The main server-side application logic is housed within the `apps/server/src/` directory.

- **Source Code**: Core server functionalities, including its entry point, API route handlers (if not exclusively in `packages/api`), middleware, services, and other server-specific modules, are located in [apps/server/src/](mdc:apps/server/src).

This directory is central to the backend operations of your project. While `packages/api` defines the API contracts and routers, `apps/server/src/` is where the server is configured and run.
