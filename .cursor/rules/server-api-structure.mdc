# Server API Structure Guide

The server API is located in [apps/server/src](mdc:apps/server/src) and works with the API package:

- [apps/server/src](mdc:apps/server/src): Contains the main server implementation.
- [packages/api/src/server](mdc:packages/api/src/server): Contains shared API logic used by the server.
- [packages/api/src/server/router](mdc:packages/api/src/server/router): Houses API route definitions organized by feature domain.

The server provides RESTful and/or GraphQL endpoints for the web client and other potential consumers. It connects to the database using the DB package and handles authentication via the auth package.
