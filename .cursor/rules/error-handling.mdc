# Error Handling Structure Guide

Error handling in the application is implemented in multiple places:

- [features/errors/](mdc:apps/web/src/features/errors): Contains error-specific components and utility functions.
- [routes/(errors)/](mdc:apps/web/src/routes/(errors)): Routes for error pages like 404, 500, etc.
- [utils/](mdc:apps/web/src/utils): Contains error handling utilities, including validation error handling.

Error boundaries are used throughout the application to catch and handle errors gracefully, providing user-friendly error messages while logging details for debugging purposes.
